I've worked on projects of all sizes, from writing Amazon product descriptions for dog bowls and hair products to large-scale documentation overhauls and net-new docs-as-code integrations. 

I even made this site from scratch with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie). 

The following are a few projects I'm most proud of.
